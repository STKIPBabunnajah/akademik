                                        The Enterprise Architect training track is meant to prepare senior software developers to assume the role of enterprise application architect, introducing him or her to the heuristics of designing and leading a software project for business applications.

                                        The heart of this program is the Enterprise Design Patterns course, or known approaches to designing business applications. This course covers approaches to designing web components, business-logic components, integration and persistence.

More than just giving you technical knowledge, we try to arm you with specific action items that you can immediately apply to your organization.

                        Orange &amp; Bronze is primarily a software development firm. Our very survival depends on successful delivery of projects. Our approach to Agile training is therefore pragmatic, not theoretical. It is not just a discussion of one methodology or another, but an analysis of why projects succeed or fail, and which practices can address specific issues. We go beyond what is written in books and articles, and bring in our own experience. What we found out by applying Agile Software Development since 2005 is that many things written in books are not always applicable in the real world, and we bring this insight to our training.

                        During the class, we try to understand your organization's specific issues and pain points, and share the various approaches that we or our clients have tried to address similar situations. More than just giving you technical knowledge, we try to arm you with specific action items that you can immediately apply to your organization.

                        This 2-day workshop provides a hands-on simulation on effective requirements elicitation practices, inclusive of having effective discussions with stakeholders, translating vague business needs into specifications, writing of user stories &amp; acceptance criteria, eliciting priorities &amp; test cases, as well as basic Agile approaches to estimation and planning.

                        User stories help us manage requirements. It may seem easy at first. Following a "As a user, I want…" template seems easy enough. But how do you know if it is an effective user story? Does it need to be split or combined? What about the details? How do we know if the story is done? What about estimating and planning? This workshop aims to immerse participants in the entire lifecycle, from initial project vision, to user roles, and to the first iteration and release.

                        Orange &amp; Bronze is one of the first companies in Asia to use and advocate Agile Software Development, and has been using it since our inception in 2005, back when Agile was still an emerging movement. This training course was developed and is taught by some of the Philippines' well-known and respected Agile coaches and practitioners, and uses the format trusted by some of the best companies in the Philippines.

                        As Martin Fowler wrote in his famous blog post, "Flaccid Scrum", many Agile Software Development efforts fail, because they do not adopt Agile Engineering practices, which are not covered by the Scrum methodology. Agile Engineering practices allow teams to accommodate frequent changes, while still delivering code that is low in bugs, and deployable at the end of each sprint.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This course goes beyond an academic discussion of Object-Oriented Design and goes into a deep discussion of its effects on practical software engineering concerns such as maintainability, testability and reuse. The course then proceeds to discuss critical Java best practices which affect performance and correctness. This is followed by a discussion on modern software engineering approaches of Test-Driven Development and Refactoring, which improve the quality and maintainability of the codebase.

                        Students are provided with numerous hands-on exercises, the most challenging of which is the final team machine problem, which includes changes to requirements mid-way!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The course culminates in a Code Review, where students present their solutions to the final machine problem to the class, for review and critique by the instructor as well as by the entire class on the basis of Object-Oriented Design principles and Java Best Practices. This activity has been effective in drilling-in proper practices and approaches to the students.

                        Design Patterns are recurring software design solutions that can be used to improve new or existing applications. The course teaches both the foundational (aka Gang of Four or GoF) design patterns as well as the Enterprise Application design patterns which focus on building enterprise applications, covering such topics as designing web components, business logic, and persistence.
